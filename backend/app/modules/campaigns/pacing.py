"""Spread a campaign's first emails over time so no mailbox is asked to send
more than its daily cap.

Until this, every message of a campaign got the same due time (the activation
start), so a 5,000-lead campaign tried to send all 5,000 in the first minute and
the send-time limiter refused almost all of them. Here each message gets its own
time, planned once when the campaign is rendered:

    place of the message in its mailbox's own queue
        -> which sending window (day) and which slot inside it
        -> a time inside that window, at least the mailbox's spacing apart

The place comes from the audience member's stable `capture_ordinal`, using the
same round-robin that picks the mailbox, so a retried or concurrent render chunk
always computes the same time for the same message.

Everything here is pure: no database, no clock.
